### Here are a few items I have created:
I work primarily in AutoCAD but I have also created full house plans using SketchUp. I also have used the rending software called [Lumion](https://lumion3d.com/3d-rendering-software.html).

This plan was a design inspired by my desire to create modern homes.

#### Modern Vacation Home Design

This is an original design. I created the CAD files in AutoCAD. I then created a 3D model in SketchUp. The 3D model was imported into the rendering software called [Lumion](https://lumion3d.com/3d-rendering-software.html) where I created these images.
